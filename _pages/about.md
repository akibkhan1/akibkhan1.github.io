Hi. Welcome to my page. I am a Ph.D. student in the Center for Imaging Science at Rochester Institute of Technology. I am a Graduate Research Assistant at the MLVision Lab under the supervision of Dr. Bartosz Krawczyk. Currently, I am doing an internship at MRIMath LLC, an FDA approved AI-based medical imaging company. I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering, with keen interest on Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Data Science. I am an avid programmer, skilled in Python and C++ with intermediate knowledge on Keras and Pytorch frameworks. My current research focuses on developing trustworthy and robust machine learning algorithms for computer vision applications.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
