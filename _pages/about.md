Hi! I am a Ph.D. student in the Center for Imaging Science at Rochester Institute of Technology. I am a Graduate Research Assistant at the MLVision Lab under the supervision of [Dr. Bartosz Krawczyk](https://www.rit.edu/directory/bxkcis-bartosz-krawczyk). 

I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering, with keen interest on Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Data Science. I am an avid programmer, skilled in Python and C++ with intermediate knowledge on Keras and Pytorch frameworks. 

My current research focuses on developing trustworthy and robust machine learning algorithms, typically VLMs, for computer vision applications by adopting the Bayesian Theory of Learning to leverage unertainty estimation.
